TODO:
	
make a better "transaction complete" popup

add a way to quickly edit info (move the delete button onto the edit page)

region should be category

gracefully handle empty input (on what?)

add a readme.txt (explain DB table/attr naming scheme)

fix the price fetching system (use the api instead of regex)

resize images in the game view so they have a maximum height proportional to the screen
(this doesn't seem to work so great with % values. convert to flex boxes first)

STRETCH:

clicking on a platform, publisher, dev, or genre in a game view does a search for all matching

add better searching/sorting methods

make the datatable sort arrow show up (missing image in source files, perhaps?)

allow mouse-free controls

integrate with personal website

insert all my games

add an extension to view specific consoles (colors, versions, etc)

Add a cached price in case site goes down/url changes/html structure changes
