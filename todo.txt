TODO:
	
make a better "transaction complete" popup

add a way to quickly edit info

add scrollable/dropdown/accordion dev/pub/genres

add price

add seed data for publishers and genres

ESRB/Region should be categories

STRETCH:

clicking on a platform, publisher, dev, or genre in a game view does a search for all matching

add better searching/sorting methods

make the datatable sort arrow show up (missing image in source files, perhaps?)

allow mouse-free controls

integrate with personal website

insert all my games

add an extension to view specific consoles (colors, versions, etc)
